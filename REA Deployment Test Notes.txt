REA Deployment Test

Preconditions/Assumptions
- used Vagrant/VirtualBox on OSX to spin up a CentOS 6.6.4 VM.
- downloaded base virtual box image https://vagrantcloud.com/puppetlabs/boxes/centos-6.6-64-puppet
- using default ruby (ruby 1.8.7 (2013-06-27 patchlevel 374) [x86_64-linux])/puppet (3.7.4) installed
- developed manifests using puppet standalone on the VM, rather than Vagrant provisioning.
- Ran into an issue with Ruby/Passenger version incompatibility (Appendix A).  Decided to proceed to code and demonstrate test requirements, rather than fix the issue.  As a result, this won't strictly be working codek once checked out. Httpd also fails to start because the installation of mod_passenger failed, and config is present to include/load it.


Security
- I would expect in a real environment, these packages and gems being installed would be located in a local repo/cache somewhere.  Upside is not having to download from the internet, versions can be frozen and managed carefully, avoiding erroneous version updates.
- Things like yum.conf could be locked down to disable/remove any default repositories, no direct access to the net, and use local repositories. Security with GPG key checking could be added to ensure only properly signed packages are installed.
- apache httpd.conf edited, my edits have a '# JG edit' comment above them, and the original is commented out
- appserver and application files owned by a different user
- I havent done it with this example, but actions relating to starting/stopping services (app/web) could be restricted with specific sudo commands, if it was required.
